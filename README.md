# Data structures and algorithms

This repo contains two projects related to data structures and algorithms. 

## Prg 1 Mapping hike
The first project (prg1) was about storing coordinates for different places and areas and how they are linked to each other in to data structures. For example, an area can be a subarea for another area, and then a place would be a child for both those areas. My data structure and algorithm choices can be seen from this [document](https://github.com/Gratschew/-SCHOOL-Data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/ab4327d8088087861a3d8f88586a2658e1fb6f51/prg1/readme.pdf)

## Prg2 Hiking map
The second project (prg2) started with storing coordinates for single points on a map combined by roads, creating a road system to appropriate data structure. Any point could work as a crossroad for a new road, or roads could even create loops. 
Example of the road system:

Then calculations like finding any route between two coordinates, the shortest distance between two coordinates (using the routes), the least crossroads between two coordinates and so on. Depth first search, breadth first search and Dijkstra's algorithm were utilized on this project in order to optimize the time complexity of those calculations.
